# Sudoku

https://hamlet-sudoku.netlify.app/

This is my implementation of the game of Sudoku! I wanted to create a version of Sudoku with all basic features including those listed below. Note that the algorithm that sets a new game each time, based on the difficulty selected, was also created by me. The application uses Javasctipt, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

##Features

- 3 levels of difficulty 
- Highlighting of row, column, and section 
- Error/conflict notification by different highlighting 
- Showing how many of each number is left to be placed 
- Persistence of the high score (saved locally)
